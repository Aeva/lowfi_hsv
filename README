--- About ---

This project contains two methods for converting from HSV color space
to RGB values.  The use that engendered these two functions was to
bring the memory usage down as much as possible when used in Arduino
sketches.

As such, this project implements hsv conversion without using floating
point variables, and should be servicable in a number of unusual
constraints.




--- Usage ---


In situations where saturation and value are assumed to be their
maximum values, use hue_to_rgb(...) for lower memory usage!  For other
situations, use hsv(...).

In both cases, all arguments are bytes (numerical values from 0 to
255), and the last three arguments are where to save the result.


So for example:

byte r;
byte g;
byte b;
byte h = 128;
byte s = 255;
byte v = 14;

hsv(h, s, v, r, g, b);



The hue_to_rgb(...) function works the same, but lacks the s and v
params.
